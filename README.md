# CS255-System-Analysis
For CS255
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project involved designing a comprehensive system for a client aiming to reduce the high failure rate of DMV driving tests. DriverPass wanted a web-based hybrid learning platform that would combine online education with practical, on-the-road training. The system needed to handle user registration, package purchases, driving lesson scheduling, online practice tests, progress tracking, and administrative functions for staff management.

What did you do particularly well?
I excelled at translating the client's broad vision into detailed, specific technical requirements. The business requirements document thoroughly captured all functional needs like role-based access control, booking workflows, and progress tracking, while the system design document provided clear UML diagrams and technical specifications that could directly guide development.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could revise one part, I would enhance the system design document with more detailed database schema specifications and API endpoint definitions. This would provide clearer guidance for developers during implementation and ensure all data relationships and integration points were fully defined from the outset.

How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing?
I interpreted user needs by carefully analyzing the client interviews and identifying both stated and implicit requirements. For example, the customer dashboard design directly implemented Liam's conceptual sketch, while the role-based access control addressed the different staff responsibilities mentioned. Considering user needs is crucial because it ensures the system actually solves the intended problems, leads to higher user adoption, and prevents costly redesigns by building the right features from the beginning.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
My approach involves starting with comprehensive requirements gathering through stakeholder interviews, followed by creating both business requirements and technical specifications. I use UML diagrams extensively to visualize system behavior and architecture. In future projects, I would continue using these techniques while incorporating more user story mapping and prototyping to validate designs with stakeholders earlier in the process.
